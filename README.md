In this project we:
handled internet based crypto jacking.
 For investigating internet based mostly crypto jacking, we created a list of internet miners so that we
can feed that into the program.
 The program designed by our team can seek for these web miners on the web site. On the off chance
that any of those web diggers are available on web site then that site will be announced malicious.
 Our project can take websites as input from user, and connect up with them via web scrapping tools
like beautiful soup and search them and present the result.
TOOLS USED:
1) Python 3.7(64-bit)
2) HTML
3) Rx64, Version-3.2.3
4) Web miner Tools:
a) Xmr studio
b)cryptonight.asm.js coinhive.com
c) coinhive.min.js jsecoin.com
d) cryptoloot.pro
METHODOLOGY ADOPTED:
We programmed a python code for not solely scanning single web site for crypto jacking threat however
additionally our project will aim to make a code in python for scanning multiple sites along that are
given as an input by the user.
